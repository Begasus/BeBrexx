<hr>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> The REXX interpreter before you is the first public release of a port
of Bill Vlachoudis' BRexx version 1.3 to BeOS, with a number of improvements and 
additions by myself, most notably the support of application scripting.</p>
<p>Note that this port is very different from David Feugey's straight port of version 2.0,
which was posted to BeWare recently.</p>
<p>Documentation for the original version can be found in the
<tt>hlp</tt> directory, which contains the following text documents: </p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="hlp/about.txt"><tt>about.txt</tt></a>, a brief description of BRexx</li>
<li> <a href="hlp/internal.txt"><tt>internal.txt</tt></a>, revealing some internal design choices</li>
<li> <a href="hlp/rx.txt"><tt>rx.txt</tt></a>, a text version of the manual</li>
<li> <a href="hlp/rxpx.txt"><tt>rxpx.txt</tt></a>, description of (for BeOS irrelevant) support for the
     Paradox database under Windows.</li>
</ul>

<p> There is also a full hypertext <a href="hlp/html/rx.html">manual</a>,
for version 1.3. Please refer to this manual and the above text files for all
documentation about REXX in general and BRexx in particular.</p>


<p> Installation instructions and information about the many changes and additions for version
1.3.2 (the BeOS version) are described below. </p>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>

<ul></ul>
<p>Installation of BRexx is not too difficult.</p>
First open a Terminal window and change to the directory into which
BRexx was unzipped:</p> 

<ul><tt>
cd /boot/home/apps/brexx
</tt></ul>

<p>(or wherever it is). Now type:</p>

<ul><tt>
make world
</tt></ul>
</ul>

<p>This causes all the programs and libraries to be compiled and linked,
and installed in the proper location. It then will run the test script
called <tt>squares.rexx</tt> to verify that the installation completed
correctly. For those who want to customize their installation, and who
are curious about where things will go, please examine the
<tt>makefile</tt>.</p>

<h2><a name="support">Support for BeOS application scripting</a></h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>One of the main functions of REXX as a language is to interact with
a "host environment". Usually the host environment is the command shell,
and BRexx version 1.3 is no exception. See the relevant manual section
for <a href="hlp/html/cmds.html">details</a>. In fact BRexx has a particularly
simple way of retrieving <a href="hlp/html/builtin.html">output from shell commands</a>.</p>

<p>The traditional way of selecting a host environment is by using the <tt>address</tt>
construct, for example:
</p>

<ul><tt>address COMMAND ls </tt></ul>

<p>The BeOS version can also interact with other environments, most notably any
application that is running under the BeOS. An example BRexx script might have: </p>

<ul><tt>address 'NetPositive'<br>
        'set Title of Window 0 to "This is a different title"'
</tt></ul>

<p>These two lines would set the window title of the first NetPositive window to 
"This is a different title". Equivalently, from the command line, we could have
just typed:</p>

<ul><tt>rx - "address 'NetPositive' 'set Title of Window 0 to \"This is a different title\"'"
</tt></ul>

<p>where we needed to escape the inner level of double-quotes.</p>

<p>One can also get information from an application. For example:</p>

<ul><tt>rx - "address 'NetPositive' 'get Title of Window 0'; say result"<br>
        This is a different title
</tt></ul>

<p> The variable <tt>result</tt> is a special variable reserved for the purpose of
returning results from commands addressed to some environment.</p>

<p> Generally, applications may return several lines worth of results. This is solved
in the BeOS version by extending the functionality of the <tt>result</tt> variable:
it is in fact a <a href="hlp/html/var.html">compound variable</a>, with
<tt>result.0</tt> containing the number of lines of results, and each result line
stored in <tt>result.i</tt> with <tt>i</tt> ranging from 1 to <tt>result.0</tt>.
Simple commands usually return a single line, and the value of <tt>result</tt> is
the same as that of <tt>result.1</tt>.
</p>

<p>Moreover, BeOS applications return results in the form of BMessages which may contain
a variety of data types in fields which may have names. In order to find out precisely what
it is that the application is returning, the <tt>result</tt> compound variable has
some additional fields, <tt>result.name.i</tt> and <tt>result.type.i</tt>. As an example,
we list the full set of "suites" that is supported by NetPositive:</p>

<ul><tt><pre>rx - "address 'NetPositive' 'getsuites'; do i = 1 to result.0; say result.name.i result.type.i result.i; end"
suites B_STRING_TYPE suite/vnd.Be-application
suites B_STRING_TYPE suite/vnd.Be-handler
messages B_PROPERTY_INFO_TYPE
        property   commands                            specifiers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Window                                       INDEX REV.INDEX 
          Window                                       NAME
          Looper                                       INDEX REV.INDEX 
          Looper                                       ID
          Looper                                       NAME
            Name   B_GET_PROPERTY                      DIRECT
          Window   B_COUNT_PROPERTIES                  DIRECT
         Loopers   B_GET_PROPERTY                      DIRECT
         Windows   B_GET_PROPERTY                      DIRECT
          Looper   B_COUNT_PROPERTIES                  DIRECT
messages B_PROPERTY_INFO_TYPE
        property   commands                            specifiers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Suites   B_GET_PROPERTY                      DIRECT
       Messenger   B_GET_PROPERTY                      DIRECT
    InternalName   B_GET_PROPERTY                      DIRECT
error B_INT32_TYPE 0</pre>
</tt></ul>

<p> In the above, various "properties" are listed, with names such as "suites", "messages",
and "error", with types such as "B_STRING_TYPE" and "B_INT32_TYPE". The "messages" property
has a <tt>result.i</tt> that contains several lines of text.</p>

<p> The implementation of BeOS-native scripting in BRexx is based on the source code for
a public domain utility called <tt>hey</tt>, written by Atilla Mezzei. The
<a href="hlp/html/appscripting.html">documentation</a>
(adapted for its usage inside BRexx) has <a href="hlp/html/appscripting.html">further details
and examples</a>.</p>

<h3>Simple scripting vs. BeOS-native scripting</h3>

<p>In the previous section I showed examples of what I call "BeOS-native scripting",
i.e. scripting that uses the BeOS built-in scripting facilities. As nice as it is
to have scripting facilities built into just about every application written on
the BeOS, it is in the end not very useful, unless the application writer puts in
one or more suites that deal with the application's internals. After all, it is
cute to be able change the title of a document window, but that change goes on behind
the back of the application itself: the application does not know the title changed,
and won't be able to save the project with the changed title.</p>

<p>In addition, when the application has several windows open, and when each window
has a complicated user interface with several elements (called a "View" in BeOS
parlance) each of which may be divided up in more elements, then it can be quite
annoying to do the simplest of things:</p>

<ul><tt>rx - "address 'SomeApp' 'get Frame of View 12 of View 3 of View 6 of Window 12'; say result"<br>
        20 20 100 100
</tt></ul>

<p> Also, the number of "verbs" allowed is limited to the following set: <tt>getsuites,
get, set, execute, count, create, delete, quit, save </tt> and <tt>load</tt>.
Admittedly, one can get pretty far with these. For example,
in order to draw a rectangle in some application, one might need to do something
like this:</p>

<ul><tt>address 'SomeApp'<br>
        'create Rectangle of View 12 of Window 6 with Frame=BRect(20,20,100,100)'"
</tt></ul>

<p>It would clearly be better if one could more directly express to an application
what it is that one wants:</p>

<ul><tt>'address 'SomeApp'<br>
         'rect 20 20 100 100'
</tt></ul> 

<p>Although there is more to the story than that, this is clearly a much more
user-friendly way of scripting an application. The BeOS version of BRexx therefore
implements an alternative way to script applications.
The drawback of this approach is that application writers need to implement this
way of scripting in their applications. Since they need to implement some form of
scripting anyway, this is not a big problem in principle. In practice, of course, it
is only useful if all application writers implement the same way of scripting. </p>

<p>In order to facilitate this way of scripting, BRexx comes with a shared library,
called <tt>libPortManager.so</tt>, which does all the work needed. The
program <tt>Squares</tt> is supplied as an example application, controlled by the
accompanying script <tt>squares.rexx</tt>.</p>


<h3><tt>PortManager</tt> and the <tt>PortManager</tt> class</h3>

<p>With BRexx comes an application called <tt>PortManager</tt>.
<tt>PortManager</tt> is started up automatically when needed, and
stays around until the system is restarted. It keeps a list of
"ports" around, that allow BRexx to communicate directly with an
application, rather than through a series of detours through the
application, its windows and the views inside of views in the
windows. BRexx first checks to see if a given port exists in the
list maintained by <tt>PortManager</tt> and if no such port exists,

BRexx checks if it is the name of an application (one can bypass the
<tt>PortManager</tt> list by prefixing the application name with
a colon).</p>

<p><tt>Other than that, PortManager</tt> and the <tt>PortManager</tt>
class are only of interest to developers wanting to implement this type
of scripting into their applications. </p>

<p> The <tt>PortManager</tt> class implements everything needed for
this type of scripting: it handles the interaction with the
<tt>PortManager</tt> application, it does most of the work involved in
scripting, and it also provides a function that will add a BeOS-native
scripting suite, so that the program can also be scripted without
BRexx (using <tt>hey</tt> for example).</p>

<p> In order to use the class, one includes the <tt>PortManager.h</tt>
header file in ones application. It is located in the <tt>PortLib</tt>
directory of the BRexx distribution. One links with the
<tt>libPortManager.so</tt> shared library, which during
installation is copied to <tt>/boot/home/config/lib</tt>.</p>


<h3>The example program Squares and squares.rexx</h3>

As an example, a program called <tt>Squares</tt> is provided in
the <tt>Squares</tt> directory. The BRexx script <tt>squares.rexx</tt>
shows how one interacts with the <tt>Squares</tt> application from
BRexx. Both are commented and fairly self-documenting.

<h2><a name="features">Additional features</a></h2>

In addition to the standard features described in the <a href="hlp/html/rx.html">manual</a>
the following changes and enhancements are present in this version of
BRexx.

<h3>File extensions supported</h3>
<ul>
     The shell command rx accepts the basename of its &ltfile&gt argument for files
     with a .r extension or a .rexx extension, in addition to files without extension.
</ul>

<h3>Desktop support</h3>
<ul>
     BRexx can also run scripts from the desktop: just choose <tt>rx</tt> from the
"Open With..." menu when you want to run a REXX script. If needed, BRexx will open
a <a href="#console">console window</a> for I/O.
</ul>

<h3>Temporary files</h3>
<ul>
     When BRexx executes commands directed to the shell environment, it creates temporary files.
     By default these files are created in /tmp for the BeOS version. A protection was applied
     such that ctrl-C's don't leave stray temporary files around.
</ul>

<h3><a name="console">The command console</a></h3>
<ul>
     The BeOS version has a "console", and all standard I/O (such as the "say" and
     "parse pull" constructs) go through this console. The advantages of this are
     two-fold. For one thing, the "parse pull" construct has command-line editing and
     command history and a host of other functions (type ctrl-R for online help). For
     another, if the BRexx script is launched from the desktop, the input and output
     are redirected to a separate "console window". This redirection can also be forced
     by the <a href="#opencon"><tt>OpenConsole()</tt></a> call. If the redirection is not
     forced, the console window will open only when I/O is performed that requires the
     window. When a BRexx script is launched from the desktop and the console is opened,
     the script will not exit until the user manually closes the window, or until the
     script forces the console window closed using the <a href="#closecon"><tt>CloseConsole()</tt></a>
     call before exiting.
</ul>

     pad character (which defaults to a space). The type can be one of three
     categories:
<li> A[pplications]: a list of main message ports for all applications that are
     currently running which accept standard BeOS messages.</li>
<li> S[ignatures]: a list of main message ports for all applications, by signature,
     that are currently running and which accept standard BeOS messages. </li>
<li> R[egistered]: a list of all ports that are registered with the PortManager
     (<a href="#support">see here</a>). </li>
</ul>

<h3><tt>statef(&ltfilename&gt)</tt></h3>
<ul> returns a string with information about the state of
     a file or a directory in the form: <br>
     <tt> FILE 597 1 RW-R----- 1998/05/20 15:47 </tt><br>
     for a file, or <br>
     <tt> DIR 2048 4 RWXR-XR-X 1999/03/10 15:33 </tt><br>
     for a directory. The order of the blank-terminated entries is: <br>
     &lttype (FILE or DIR)&gt &ltsize (in bytes)&gt &ltsize (in blocks)&gt  &ltprotection bits&gt
     &ltdate last modified&gt &lttime last modified&gt<br>
     This function follows links.
</ul>

<h3><tt>upper(s)</tt></h3>
<ul> returns string s converted to all uppercase. </ul>

<h3><tt><a name="opencon">OpenConsole</a>([&ltwindow title&gt] [,&ltleft&gt, &lttop&gt, &ltwidth&gt, &ltheight&gt])</tt></h3>
<ul> If the console window is not yet open, this opens a console window, with the
     optional title and/or location/size. if the console window is already open, the
     window title is changed, if the first argument is present, and the window location
     and size are changed when the second through last argument are present.
     See also <a href="#console">here</a>.
</ul>

<h3><tt><a name="closecon">CloseConsole</a>()</tt></h3>
<ul> Closes the console window (if it is open). See also <a href="#console">here</a>. </ul>
