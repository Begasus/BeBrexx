BeBRexx 1.3.2 is the first public release of a port of Bill
Vlachoudis' BRexx version 1.3 to BeOS, a REXX interpreter with
a number of improvements and additions by myself:

- Support for BeOS application scripting.
- Support for running BRexx scripts from the desktop.
- Additional functions and features.

Note that this port is very different from David Feugey's
straight port of version 2.0, which was posted to BeWare
recently.

For further information, see README.html.
