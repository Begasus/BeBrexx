  Description: A simple program that demonstrates use of the PortManager
        Notes: This program is a simple example of the use of the PortManager,
               a proposed way of making applications scriptable at a more
               user-oriented level. The program implements a window with
               a view. The view is scriptable and understands a few simple
               commands.

               Thanks to Michael Crawford for writing CircleToy, from which
               this code started. It was rewritten from scratch eventually.
