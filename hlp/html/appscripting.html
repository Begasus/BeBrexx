<center><h1> BeOS native scripting Using BRexx Version 1.3.2 for BeOS. </h1></center>
<center><h2>based on <tt>hey</tt> and the <tt>hey</tt> documentation by Attila Mezei</h2></center>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Within BRexx, the syntax of BeOS-native scripting commands is:</p?

<PRE><CODE>
address &lt;app|signature&gt; "&lt;verb&gt; &lt;specifier_1&gt; &lt;of &lt;specifier_n&gt;&gt;* [to &lt;value&gt;]
           [with name=&ltvalue&gt [and name=&ltvalue&gt]*]"

where &lt;verb&gt; : get|set|count|create|delete|getsuites|quit|save|load|execute|'what'
      &lt;specifier&gt; : &lt;property_name&gt; [ '['index']' | '['-reverse_index']' |
                     '['fromvalue to tovalue']' | name | "name" ]
      &lt;value&gt; : "string" | &lt;integer&gt; | &lt;float&gt; | bool(value) | int8(value) |
                int16(value) | int32(value) | float(value) | double(value) |
                BPoint(x,y) | BRect(l,t,r,b) | rgb_color(r,g,b,a) | file(path)   

</CODE></PRE>
<br>

<h3>The verb</h3>
The verbs send the following messages:
<ul>
<li>get: B_GET_PROPERTY
<li>set: B_SET_PROPERTY
<li>count: B_COUNT_PROPERTIES
<li>create: B_CREATE_PROPERTY
<li>delete: B_DELETE_PROPERTY
<li>getsuites: B_GET_SUPPORTED_SUITES
<li>quit: B_QUIT_REQUESTED
<li>save: B_SAVE_REQUESTED
<li>load: B_REFS_RECEIVED
<li>execute: B_EXECUTE_PROPERTY
</ul>

Note that the verb is not case sensitive but the specifier names (e.g. "Frame", "Label"...) are.
You can use 'what' constants directly, like
<PRE><CODE>address "Application" "_ABR"
</CODE></PRE>
will open the about window of the application.<p>
<tt>load</tt> and <tt>save</tt> are actually not scripting commands, they are standard
BeOS messages. They are included for convenience. E.g. open a file in Application (the
path can be relative or absolute):
<PRE><CODE>address "Application" "load file(/boot/home/images/Be.jpg)"
</CODE></PRE>
or save it:
<PRE><CODE>address "Application" 'save Window "Be.jpg"'
</CODE></PRE>
<p>Whether the application does something with these messages is a different story.</p>

<br>

<h3>The specifier</h3>

<p>The specifier can be direct, index, reverse index, range or named. Reverse range is
not supported. If you enter an index which consists of only digits, you can omit the square
brackets:
<PRE><CODE>address "Application" "get Window 0"
</CODE></PRE>

<br>
<h3>The value</h3>

It is easy to use the type names in front of the value:
<PRE><CODE>address "Application" "set .... to BPoint(100,100)"
</CODE></PRE>
You can also use square brackets:
<PRE><CODE>address "Application" "set .... to BPoint[100,100]"
</CODE></PRE>

If the value string contains only digits, it will be considered an int32.
If it contains digits and a dot, a float type is assumed. "true" or "false" can also be
used as bools.

<h2>Examples</h2>

For these examples you need to start the Network preferences application
(the classic way to demo scripting ;-)


<h3>Get the suite of messages which the application can handle:</h3>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" "getsuites"
do i = 1 to result.0
   say result.name.i result.type.i result.i
end
</CODE></PRE>
<p> This prints the BApplication and BHandler suites. </p>
</ul>
<h3>Get the name of the application</h3>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" "get Name"
say result
</CODE></PRE>
<h3>Open the about window of the application</h3>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" "_ABR"
</CODE></PRE>
<h3>Get a window of the application (actually a messenger for the window)</h3>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" "get Window [0]"
say result
</CODE></PRE>or you can omit the square brackets when using an index:
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" "get Window 0"
say result
</CODE></PRE>or you can specify a window name:
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" 'get Window Network'
say result
</CODE></PRE>
<h3>Get the suite of messages which the window can handle:</h3>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" 'getsuites of Window Network'
do i = 1 to result.0
   say result.name.i result.type.i result.i
end
</CODE></PRE>for the description of suite/vnd.Be-window see the BeBook.

<h3>Get the title, frame or other properties of the window:</h3>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" 'get Title of Window Network'
say result

address "Network" 'get Frame of Window Network'
say result
</CODE></PRE>
<h3>Set the title, frame or other properties of the window:</h3>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" 'set Title of Window Network to "hey is great"'
</PRE></CODE>
<p>Note that the above changes the name of the window, and so it is best to
set it back to "Network", or else the following commands won't work.</p>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" 'set Frame of Window Network to BRect(0,0,300,300)'
</CODE></PRE>or
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" 'set Frame of Window Network to BRect[0,0,300,300]'
</CODE></PRE>
<p>(You will get an error for these last two, since the Network preferences
window is not resizable. However, it works with NetPositive's windows).</p>
<h3>Get the suite of messages which the view can handle:</h3>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" 'getsuites of View 0 of Window Network'
do i = 1 to result.0
   say result.name.i result.type.i result.i
end
</CODE></PRE>For a description of suite/vnd.Be-view see the BeBook.

<h3>Get a view property:</h3>
<p>As we get to more complicated commands, you should see them as samples only.
Most of them do not work with later versions of BeOS, because the layout of
of the Network prefs application has changed.</p>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" 'get Frame of View 0 of Window Network'
say result

address "Network" 'get Hidden of View 0 of View 0 of Window Network'
say result

address "Network" 'get Label of View 5 of View 0 of Window Network'
say result

address "Network" 'get Value of View 0 of View 2 of View 0 of Window Network'
say result

address "Network" 'get Text of View 2 of View 2 of View 0 of Window Network'
say result
</CODE></PRE>
<h3>Set a view property:</h3>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" 'set Frame of View 0 of Window Network to BRect(0,0,100,400)'
address "Network" 'set Hidden of View 0 of View 0 of Window Network to true'
address "Network" 'set Label of View 5 of View 0 of Window Network to "Restart Something"'
address "Network" 'set Value of View 0 of View 2 of View 0 of Window Network to 1'
address "Network" 'set Text of View 2 of View 2 of View 0 of Window Network to "joe"'
</CODE></PRE>
<h3>Close a window in an application</h3>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" 'quit Window Network'
</CODE></PRE>
<h3>Quit an application</h3>
<PRE><CODE>address "Network" "quit"
</CODE></PRE>
