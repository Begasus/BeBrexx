      Issuing Commands to Host System
</H1>

      In this REXX version all the commands are executed via
      command interpreter (normally COMMAND.COM)
         So valid environments are:
          o  <B>COMMAND, SYSTEM, DOS, ''</B>: load and execute command
             interpreter from COMSPEC env. variable.
+         o  <B>INT2E</B>: executes commands via interrupt 2E
+            the undocumented back door to COMMAND.COM.
+            Normally it is faster then environments <B>COMMAND</B> etc.
+            because there is no need to load an extra copy of
+            COMMAND.COM before execute the command.
+            Note. Commands executed through <B>INT2E</B> cannot be
+            redirected to stack. There is a BUG that causes
+            sometimes a Fatal error. While executing a cmd
+            via int2e and you press Control-C you may have
+            some very strange results.

      A command is an expression, which may include
      function-calls, arithmetic operations, and so on. Operators
      or other special characters (for example, "(" or "*") must
      be specified in a string if they are to appear in the
      issued command.

|     Commands to environments <B>COMMAND</B>, <B>SYSTEM</B> may return its
|     result to REXX stack when at the end of cmd appears the
|     string <B>(STACK</B>, <B>(FIFO</B> or <B>(LIFO</B> (with the parenthesis).
|                    <B>"dir (stack"</B>
|     If the string <B>STACK></B> appears in the beginning of cmd, then
|     stack is redirected to stdin of cmd.
|                    <B>"stack> date"</B>
|     Stack is flushed after redirecting it to stdin.

      Redirection to or from STACK will create a temporary file
      with name like OAA.AAB that will be erased. It is nice
      to redirect all your temporary pipe files to a temporary
      directory. To do this set in your AUTOEXEC.BAT a new line
      containing:
                 <I>SET TEMP=C:\TEMP</I>
      where C:\TEMP is the temporary directory (which must exist)
      and you must have Read/Write authority.
      (Look also below at <B>LOAD</B> function )
