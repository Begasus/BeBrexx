      Interactive Debugging
</H1>

      You can enter the interactive debuging either by executing
      a <B>TRACE</B> instruction with a prefix "?" or when calling RX
      from dos command line issue as a first argument the trace
      option:   <I>C:> rx ?r awari.r</I>
      In interactive debug, interpreter pauses before the execution
      of the instructions that are to be traced and prompts for
      input. You may do one of following things:
       o  Enter a null line to continue execution.
       o  Enter a list of REXX instructions, which are
          interpreted immediately (<B>DO-END</B> instructions must be
          complete, etc.).

          During the execution of the string, no tracing takes
          place, except that non-zero return codes from host
          commands are displayed. Execution of a <B>TRACE</B> instruction
          with the "?" prefix turns off interactive debug mode.
          Other <B>TRACE</B> instructions affect the tracing that occurs
          when normal execution continues.
