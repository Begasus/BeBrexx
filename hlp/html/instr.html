      Instructions                                      
</H1>
                                                        
      Each REXX instruction is one ore more clauses, the first clause
      is the one that identifies the instruction. Instructions end
      with a semicolon or with a new line. One instruction may be
      continued from one line to the next by using a comma at the end
      of the line. Open strings or comments are not affected by line
      ends.


<H2>
      The General Guidelines are:
</H2>

      <B>name</B>
           refers to a variable, which can be assigned any value.
           name is a symbol with the following exception: the
           first character may not be a digit or a period. The
           value of name is translated to uppercase before use, and
           forms the initial value of the value of the variable.
           Some valid names are:
                <B>Fred  COST?  next  index   A.j</B>

      <B>name:</B>
           is a form of labels for <B>CALL</B> instructions, <B>SIGNAL</B>
           instructions, and internal function calls. The colon
           acts as a clause separator.

      <B>template</B>
           is a parsing template, described in a later section.

      <B>instr</B>
           is any one of the listed instructions.

<H2>
      The Instructions are:
</H2>

      <B>expression</B>
           the value of expression is issued as a command, normally
           to the command interpreter or to the specified environment
           specified by the <B>ADDRESS</B> instruction. Look also the section
           "Issuing Commands to Host System."
           ie.         <B>'DIR' '*.exe'</B>

      <B>name = [expr];</B>
           is an assignment: the variable name is set to the value
           of expr.
           ie.       <B>fred = 'sunset'</B>
                     <B>a    = 1 + 2 * 3</B>
                     <B>a    = </B>           /* a contains '' */

      <B>ADDRESS [<symbol | string> [expr]];</B>
          redirect commands or a single command to a new
          environment. <B>ADDRESS VALUE expr</B> may be used
          for an evaluated environment name.
          ie.       <B>address int2e 'dir'</B>  /* executes through int2e a dir cmd
                    <B>address system</B>       /* all the following command will be
                                            addressed to system */
                    <B>env = 'dos'</B>
                    <B>address value env</B>    /* change address to dos */

      <B>ARG <template>;</B>
          parse argument string(s) given to program or in an
          internal routine into variables according to template.
          Arguments are translated into uppercase before the parsing.
          Short for <B>PARSE UPPER ARG</B>.
          ie.   /* program is called with args  "autoexec.bat auto.old"
                <B>arg src dest</B>
                /* src = "AUTOEXEC.BAT", dest="AUTO.OLD" */

                /* a function is called MARMITA('Bill',3)
                <B>marmita:</B>
                <B>arg firstarg, secondarg</B>
                /* firstarg = "BILL", secondarg = "3" */

      <B>CALL [symbol | string] [<expr>] [,<expr>]... ;</B>
          call an internal routine, an external routine or program,
          or a built-in function. Depending on the type of
          routine called, the variable <B>RESULT</B> contains the result
          of the routine. <B>RESULT</B> is uninitialized if no result is
          returned.
          ie.       <B>call substr 'makedonia',2,3</B>
                  /* now. variable result = 'ake' */
                  /* the same can be obtained with */
                    <B>result = substr('makedonia',2,3)</B>

          In the following sections there is a description of
          all the built-in rexx functions.

          Internal functions are sequence of instructions inside the
          same program starting at the label that matches the name in
          the <B>CALL</B> instruction.

          External routines are like internal but written in
          a separate module that can be used as a library. In this
          REXX external routines must be loaded with the built-in
          function <B>LOAD</B> before the are used (see below).

          As external routines can be used any DOS command or program
          that uses standard input and output. (<B>LOAD</B> affects only REXX
          routines)
                  /* external programs can be called as routines */
                  /* and the output of the program (to stdout) will */
                  /* be returned as the result string of the function */
                    <B>call "dir" "*.exe","/w"</B>    /* or */
                    <B>files = "dir"('*.exe',"/w")</B>
                    <B>current_directory = 'cd'()</B>

      <B>DO      [ [name=expri  [TO exprt] [BY exprb]</B>
                <B>[FOR exprf]] | [ FOREVER | exprr ]</B>
              <B>[UNTIL expru | WHILE exprw] ;</B>
              <B>[instr]... ;</B>
      <B>END [symbol] ;</B>
          <B>DO</B> is used to group many instructions together and
          optionally executes them repetively.
       o  Simple <B>DO</B> loop are used to execute a block of instructions
          often used with <B>IF-THEN</B> statements.
          Note. Simple <B>DO</B> loops are not affected with
          <B>ITERATE</B> or <B>LEAVE</B> instructions (see below)
          ie. <B>If name = 'VIVI' then Do</B>
                                    <B>i = i + 1</B>
                                    <B>Say 'Hello Vivi'</B>
                                    <B>End</B>

       o  Simple repetitive loops.
          ie.   <B>do 3</B>               /* would display 3 'hello' */
                   <B>say 'hello'</B>
                <B>end</B>
          Note. <B>DO expr, expr</B> must evaluate to an integer number.

                <B>do forever</B>             /* infinite loop, display always */
                   <B>say 'lupe forever'</B>  /* 'hello' */
                <B>end</B>

       o  Loops with control variable. name is stepped from <B>expri</B>
          to <B>exprt</B> in steps of <B>exprb</B>, for a maximum of <B>exprf</B> iterations.
                <B>do i = 1 to 10 by 3</B>    /* would display the numbers */
                   <B>say i</B>               /* 1, 4, 7, 10 */
                <B>end</B>
          Note. all the expressions are evaluated before the loop is
          executed and may result to any kind of number, integer or real.

       o  Conditional loops
            ie.   <B>a = 2</B>                /* would display */
                  <B>do while a < 5</B>       /*  2  */
                     <B>say a</B>             /*  4  */
                     <B>a = a + 2</B>
                  <B>end</B>
            Note. <B>exprw</B> and <B>expru</B> are evaluated in each iteration and
            must result to 0 or 1. <B>WHILE</B> expression is evaluated before
            each iteration, where <B>UNTIL</B> expression is evaluated at the
            end of each iteration.

          You can combine them like:
                  <B>a = 1</B>                  /* would display */
                  <B>do for 3 while a < 5</B>   /*  1  */
                     <B>say a</B>               /*  2  */
                     <B>a = a + 1</B>           /*  3  */
                  <B>end</B>

       <B>DROP name [name]... ;</B>
          drop (reset) the named variables or group of variables
          by freeing their memory. It returns them in their original
          uninitialized state.
          If an exposed variable is named, the variable itself
          in the older generation will be dropped!
          If a stem is specified all variables starting with that stem
          will be dropped.
          ie.        <B>j = 2</B>
                     <B>drop a x.1 y.j</B>   /* resets variables A X.1 and Y.2 */
                     <B>drop z.</B>          /* resets all variables with names
                                         starting with Z. */

      <B>EXIT [expr] ;</B>
          leave the program (with return data, expr). <B>EXIT</B> is
          the same as <B>RETURN</B> except that all internal routines
          are terminated.
          ie.       <B>exit  12*3</B>       /* will exit the program with rc=36 */

      <B>IF expr [;] THEN [;] instr ;</B>
                 <B>[ELSE [;] instr];</B>
          if <B>expr</B> evaluates to <B>"1"</B>, execute the instruction
          following the <B>THEN</B>. Otherwise, when expr evaluates to <B>"0"</B>,
          the instruction after <B>ELSE</B> is executed, if <B>ELSE</B> is present.
          ie.  <B>if name="bill" then say "Hello billy."</B>
                              <B>else say "Hello stranger"</B>


      <B>INTERPRET  expr ;</B>
          <B>expr</B> is evaluated and then is processed, as it was a
          part of the program.
          ie.  <B>cmd = "say 'Hello'"</B>
               <B>interpret cmd </B>    /* displayes "Hello" */

      <B>ITERATE   [name] ;</B>
          start next iteration of the innermost repetitive loop
          (or loop with control variable name).
          ie.  <B>do i = 1 to 5</B>           /* would display:  1  */
                  <B>if i=3 then iterate</B>  /*                 2  */
                  <B>say i</B>                /*                 4  */
               <B>end</B>                     /*                 5  */

      <B>LEAVE     [name] ;</B>
          terminate innermost repetitive loop (or loop with control
          variable name).
          ie.  <B>do i = 1 to 5</B>           /* would display:  1  */
                  <B>if i=3 then leave</B>    /*                 2  */
                  <B>say i</B>
               <B>end</B>

      <B>LOWER name [name]...</B>
          translate the values of the specified individual
          variables to lowercase.
          ie.   <B>name = 'ViVi'</B>
                <B>lower name</B>           /* now, name = 'vivi' */

      <B>NOP ;</B>
          dummy instruction, has no effect.
          ie.   <B>if name='vivi' then nop; else say 'Hello vivi.'</B>

      <B>NUMERIC  DIGITS [expr]  |</B>
               <B>FORM   [SCIENTIFIC | ENGINEERING] |</B>
               <B>FUZZ   [expr]  ;</B>
-         dummy instruction, has no effect, just for compatibility
-         with VM/CMS REXX.

      <B>PARSE   [UPPER]  + ARG               | [template] ;</B>
                       <B>| AUTHOR            |</B>
                       <B>| EXTERNAL          |</B>
                       <B>| NUMERIC           |</B>
                       <B>| PULL              |</B>
                       <B>| SOURCE            |</B>
                       <B>| VALUE [expr] WITH |</B>
                       <B>| VAR name          |</B>
                       <B>+ VERSION           +</B>
          Parse is used to assign data from various sources to
          one or more variables according to the template
          (see below for template patterns)
          o  <B>ARG</B>, parses the argument string(s) passed to the program,
             subroutine, or function. <B>UPPER</B> first translates the
             strings to uppercase. See also the <B>ARG</B> instruction.
+         o  <B>AUTHOR</B> parse the author string.
          o  <B>EXTERNAL</B>, prompts for input and parses the input string
          o  <B>NUMERIC</B>, parse the current <B>NUMERIC</B> settings.
          o  <B>PULL</B>, read and parse the next string from rexx stack
             if not empty otherwise prompts from input
             See the <B>PULL</B> instruction.
          o  <B>SOURCE</B>, parse the program source description e.g.
             "CMS COMMAND FRED EXEC A fred CMS".
          o  <B>VALUE</B>, parse the value of <B>expr</B>.
          o  <B>VAR</B>, parse the value of <B>name</B>.
          o  <B>VERSION</B>, parse the version string of the interpreter.

      <B>PROCEDURE [EXPOSE name [name]...] ;</B>
          start a new generation of variables within an internal
          routine. Optionally named variables or groups of
          variables from an earlier generation may be exposed.
          If a stem is specified (variable ending in '.' dot, ie 'A.')
          then every variable starting with this stem will be exposed
               <B>i = 1; j = 2</B>
               <B>call myproc</B>
               <B>exit</B>
               <B>myproc: procedure expose i</B>     /* would display */
               <B>say i j</B>                        /* 1 J */
               <B>return</B>

      <B>PULL   [template] ;</B>
          pops the next string from rexx internal stack. If stack
          is empty then it prompts for input. Translates it
          to uppercase and then parses it according to template.
          Short for <B>PARSE UPPER PULL</B>.
               <B>push 'Bill Vlachoudis'</B>
             /* --- many instrs ---- */
               <B>pull name surname</B>          /* now: name='BILL',         */
                                          /*      surname='VLACHOUDIS' */

      <B>PUSH   [expr] ;</B>
          push <B>expr</B> onto head of the rexx queue (stack LIFO)

      <B>QUEUE  [expr] ;</B>
          add <B>expr</B> to the tail of the rexx queue (stack FIFO)

      <B>RETURN [expr] ;</B>
          return control from a procedure to the point of its invocation.
          if <B>expr</B> exits, then it is returned as the result of the
          procedure.
                <B>num = 6</B>
                <B>say num || '! = ' fact(num)</B>
                <B>exit</B>
                <B>fact: procedure</B>               /* calculate factorial with */
                <B>if arg(1) = 0 then return 1</B>   /* recursion */
                <B>return fact(arg(1)-1) * arg(1)</B> /* displayes: 6! = 720 */

      <B>SAY [expr];</B>
          evaluate <B>expr</B> and then writes the result to standard output
          (normally user's console) followed by a newline.

      <B>SELECT ;</B>
         <B>WHEN expr [;] THEN [;] instr;</B>
       <B>[ WHEN expr [;] THEN [;] instr; ]</B>
       <B>[ OTHERWISE [;] [instr]... ];</B>
      <B>END ;</B>
          <B>SELECT</B> is used to conditionally process one of several alternatives.
          Each <B>WHEN</B> expression is evaluated in sequence until
          one results in "1". instr, immediately following it, is
          executed and control leaves the block. If no
          expr evaluated to "1", control passes to the
          instructions following the <B>OTHERWISE</B> expression
          that must then be present.
               <B>num = 10</B>
               <B>select</B>
                  <B>when num > 0 then say num 'is positive'</B>
                  <B>when num < 0 then say num 'is negative'</B>
                  <B>otherwise  say num 'is zero'</B>
