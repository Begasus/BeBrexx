      Special Variables

      There are three special variables:

      <B>SIGL</B>
             holds the line number of the instruction that
             was last executed before control of program was
             transferred to another place. This can be caused
             by a <B>SIGNAL</B> instruction, a <B>CALL</B> instruction or
             a trapped error condition.

      <B>RC</B>
             is set to the errorlevel (return-code) after execution
             of every command (to host).

      <B>RESULT</B>
             is set by a <B>RETURN</B> instruction in a <B>CALL</B>ed procedure.
