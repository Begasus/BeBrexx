      Templates for ARG, PULL, and PARSE                
</H1>
                                                        
      The <B>PULL</B>, <B>ARG</B> and <B>PARSE</B> instructions use a template to
      parse a string.

      - The simplest template is a list of variables where is
        each of them is assigned one word from the string, except
        the last variable in the list which will contain the rest
        of the string.
           <B>parse value "one two   three four " with a b c</B>
             now a="one"; b="two"; c="three four"
           <B>parse value "one two   three four " with a b c d e</B>
             now a="one"; b="two"; c="three"; d="four" and e=""
        A dot <B>'.'</B> can be in the place of one or more variables,
        it is used as a place-holder.
           <B>parse value "one two   three four " with a . . d</B>
             now a="one"; d="four"

      - A more complex parsing is to use patterns for triggering.
           <B>number</B>    - which specifies an absolute position in string
                       1 - is the first character in string
         <B>[+|-]number</B> - signed numbers are used as a relative positioning

           <B>parse value "one two   three four " with 2 a 6 b</B>
             now a="ne t"; b="wo   three four "
           <B>parse value "one two   three four " with 2 a +2 b</B>
             now a="ne"; b=" two   three four "

         <B>string</B>    - may be used as a target position.
           <B>parse value "marmita/bill/vivi' with a '/' b '/' c</B>
             now a="marmita"; b="bill"; c="vivi"
         (name)    - also as a target may be used a variable
                     encolsed in parenthesis
           <B>t = "%%"</B>
           <B>parse value "aabbcc%%ddeeff%%gg%%" with . (t) middle (t) .</B>
             now middle="ddeeff"

      A <B>comma</B> can be used as a "trigger" to move to the next
      string when there is more than one to be parsed (e.g. when
      there is more than one argument string to a routine).
           <B>call myproc 'Hi',3,4</B>
           <B>exit</B>
           <B>myproc:</B>
           <B>parse arg first, second, third</B>  /* now first="Hi"  */
           <B>...</B>                             /*     second=3    */
                                           /*     third=4     */
