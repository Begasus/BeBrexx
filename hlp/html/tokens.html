      REXX expressions and instructions may contain the following
      items:

      comment
          A comment is a sequence of characters (on one or
          more lines) delimited by <B>/*</B> and <B>*/</B>. Nested comments
          are also valid, as <B>/* hello /* joe */ */</B>

      string
          A string is a sequence of characters delimited by a
          single quote or double quote. Use two quotes to
          obtain one quote inside a string. A string may be
          specified in hexadecimal if the final quote is
+         followed by an X. If it followed by an H then is
+         treated as a hexadecimal number. Some valid
          strings are:
            <B>"Marmita" 'He''s here'  '2ed3'x  '10'h (=16)</B>

      number
          A number is a string of decimal digits with or without
          a decimal point. A number may be prefixed with a plus
          or minus sign, and/or written in exponential notation.
          Some valid numbers are:
            <B>23  12.07  141 12.2e6  +5  '-3.14'</B>

      symbol
          A symbol refers to any group of characters from the
          following selection:

             <B>A-Z, a-z, 0-9, @#$_.?!</B>

          Symbols are always translated to uppercase. Variables
          are symbols but the first character must not be a
          digit 0-9 or a dot '.'. Each symbol may consist of
          up to 250 characters.

      function-call
          A function-call invokes an internal, external, or
          built-in routine with 0 to 10 argument strings.
          The called routine returns a character string.
          A function-call has the format:

          <B>function-name( [expr][,[expr]...)</B>

          function-name must be adjacent to the left
          parenthesis, and may be a symbol or a string.

          All procedures can be called as functions or procedures.
          If a function is called as a procedure ie. <B>call left 'Hello',4</B>
          then the return string will be returned in the variable
          <B>RESULT</B> where is this example will contain the string 'Hell'

          ie.   <B>copies('ab',3)</B>  /* will return 'ababab' */
                <B>'cd'()</B>          /* will call DOS and return
                                    current directory */
