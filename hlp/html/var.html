      Compound Variable Names

      name may be "compound" in that it may be composed of
      several parts (separated by periods) some of which may have
      variable values. The parts are then substituted independently,
      to generate a fully resolved name. In general,

      <B>s0.s1.s2.---.sn</B>         is substituted to form

      <B>d0.v1.v2.---.vn</B>         where d0 is uppercase of s0, and
                              v1-vn are values of s1-sn

      This facility may be used for traditional arrays,
      content-addressable arrays, and other indirect addressing
      modes. As an example, the sequence:

        <B>J = 5;  a.j = "fred";</B>

      would assign fred to the variable <B>A.5</B>.

      The stem of name (i.e. that part up to and including the
      first ".") may be specified on the <B>DROP</B> and <B>PROCEDURE</B>
      <B>EXPOSE</B> instructions and affect all variables starting with
      that stem. An assignment to a stem assigns the new value to
      all possible variables with that stem.
